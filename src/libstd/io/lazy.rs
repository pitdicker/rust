/// Helper for lazy initialization of a static, with a destructor that runs when the main (Rust)
/// thread exits.
///
/// Currently used only inside the standard library, by the stdio types.
///
/// # Safety
/// - We use the low-level `Mutex` primitive from `sys_common`, which should not be acquired
///   reentrantly.
/// - `UnsafeCell`: Be careful to uphold the aliasing guarantees. We only create a mutable reference
///   during initialization and during the shutdown phase. At both times there can't exist any other
///   references.
/// - Initialization. The `init` function for `get` should not call `get` itself, to prevent
///   acquiring the mutex reentrantly.
/// - Destruction. The `Drop` implementation of `T` should not access references to anything except
///   itself, they are not guaranteed to exist. It should also not rely on other machinery of the
///   standard library to be available.
